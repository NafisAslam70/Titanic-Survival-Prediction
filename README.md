# **Titanic Survival Prediction**
Based on Logistic Regression
This repository contains code for predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## **Introduction**

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a significant portion of the passengers and crew. This project aims to analyze the Titanic passenger data and build a predictive model to determine the factors that influence survival.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It consists of various features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, cabin, and embarkation port. The target variable is whether the passenger survived or not.

## **Code**

The code provided in this repository includes:

- **Data preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory data analysis:** Visualizing the distribution of features and exploring relationships between variables.
- **Model building:** Implementing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression to predict survival.
- **Model evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models using accuracy metrics.

## **Usage**

To use this code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` to execute the code and reproduce the results.
